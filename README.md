# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This project, created for the above EdX course, was created to consolidate basic
information about the three D&D campaigns I run - namely, two fifth edition
campaigns (Ghosts of Saltmarsh and Tomb of Annihilation) and a 3.5 campaign
(Conflux).

Below is a brief list and description of all the files associated with this
project:

Index.html houses the homepage.
styles.scss and styles.css has the site's stylization code.
script.js contains the JS script.

The 'campaigns' folder contains the HTML files of the three campaign pages.

I hope you enjoy. Roll initiative!
